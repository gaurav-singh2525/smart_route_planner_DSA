# smart_route_planner_DSA
A DSA-focused route planning system built using C++ (Qt Framework) that visualizes and computes the shortest path between Indian cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The project demonstrates practical use of graphs and adjacency lists in a real-world scenario — integrated with an interactive map (Leaflet.js) for user input and visualization.
